A bunch of miscellaeous controls for [rm3](https://github.com/rm3web/rm3).

This package includes
 * Simple form error display
 * Simple input for a [SitePath](https://github.com/rm3web/sitepath).
 * Password form that also checks the password strength using [zxcvbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zxcvbn).

## Contributing

If you've found a bug:
 * Submit away!

If you'd like to submit a PR:
 * I do not expect you to smash multiple commits into a single commit.
 * Unless you say otherwise, I'm assuming "maintainer-fixes" style of merging, where I fix any quibbles and potentially make minor tweaks.  If you specify "maintainer-reviews", I'll maintain a list of things that I've identified for you to change.
 * If you've got a major patch in mind that's larger than an easily-mergable patch, you might consider writing up a blueprint describing what you want to do.
